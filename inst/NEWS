Changelog for 'lsmeans' package

0.99 - August 27, 2012
    Now can handle predictors coerced to 'factor' or 'ordered'
    Now can handle predictors deleted due to rank deficiency
    Now can handle models with matrices among the predictors
        (uses 'cov.reduce' on each column; 'at' not supported for matrix covariate)
    Added support for gls objects (and documented that it works also for glm and glmer)
    Added a check for empty cells in the design (relative to the model). This (by default)
        forces a NA to be outputted for any lsmeans that are corrupted by rank deficiencies
    Generates a warning if specified factor(s) interact with other predictors
    Better and more comprehensive vignette
    Added a whole lot of comments to the code (you won't see these, but be glad,
        as it greatly aids maintainability)
    Added error messages for anticipatable user errors
    Numerous bug fixes and corrections to documentation
    Still no d.f. or P values. Those could take awhile.
    
0.90 - August 14, 2012
    First release, still needs some refinements and bullet-proofing
